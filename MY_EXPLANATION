1. War packaging triggers War plugin. The plugin builds a .war file which contains basically the jsp. Classes are not included because the plugin expects them under src/main/java. Jetty web server will serve the war

2. During the generate-sources phase, classes and resources under src/it are considered in order to build the project

3. Jetty web server starts during pre-integration-test phase

3. maven-failsafe-plugin plugin executes integration tests during the integration-test phase by searching for classes ending in IT

5. RunCuckesIT is run by the Cucumber runner, which executes the step definitions in LoadPageStepDef. These step definitions use the WebDriver of Selenium in order to query Jetty

6. Jetty web server stops during post-integration-test phase

7. maven-failsafe-plugin plugin verifies integration tests success
